This project is designed to classify lung cancer using CT scan images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system processes medical images to determine whether a patient is likely to have lung cancer.
The workflow includes multiple steps such as preprocessing images, defining and training a model, fine-tuning through pruning, and deploying the model via a user-friendly Streamlit interface. 
This project aims to support early diagnosis and assist medical professionals in decision-making.
